            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I’m Yasmine, a 25-year-old IT specialist whose fascination with technology began early in childhood. Growing up, I was captivated not only by the magic of programming and software but also by the intricate physical components of computers and devices. This dual interest in both software and hardware has shaped my approach to IT — I believe in understanding technology inside and out, combining coding skills with hands-on experience to create comprehensive solutions.

While programming challenges and logical problem-solving fuel my curiosity, I equally enjoy working directly with hardware — building, troubleshooting, and optimizing systems. This balance allows me to bridge the gap between abstract code and tangible technology, giving me a unique perspective and skill set in the IT field. I created this website as a portfolio to showcase my passion for computer science and to document the projects and experiences that have contributed to my growth.

I am deeply committed to continuous learning and professional development, eager to explore new technologies, frameworks, and hardware innovations. The IT landscape is constantly evolving, and I embrace that evolution by staying curious, adaptable, and proactive in expanding my expertise. Through my work, I aim to develop efficient, innovative solutions that not only solve problems but also enhance user experiences and system performance.

Collaboration is also a core part of my professional philosophy. I enjoy connecting with fellow technology enthusiasts and professionals to share ideas, learn from one another, and contribute to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. This portfolio is more than just a showcase — it’s an invitation to engage, connect, and create together.

Looking forward, I aspire to deepen my skills in both software development and hardware engineering, continually blending these disciplines to deliver impactful results. My passion for technology is matched only by my dedication to using it as a tool for innovation and progress.</p>
